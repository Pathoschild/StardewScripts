This script can be run on Nexus to clean up messy notification lists. It will...

* hide all but the latest new-comments notification for each mod:
  ```
  3 new comments on ExampleMod (2 hours ago)  <-- keep this one, hide the rest
  2 new comments on ExampleMod (1 day ago)
  3 new comments on ExampleMod (2 days ago)
  5 new comments on ExampleMod (3 days ago)
  ```
* optionally hide notifications of specific types (e.g. friend requests);
* optionally hide notifications from specific mods;
* optionally mark hidden notifications as read.

# Usage

1. Optionally configure the settings near the top of the script.
2. Click the notification icon on Nexus.
