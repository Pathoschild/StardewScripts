This script adds download buttons for archived mod files on Nexus Mods (e.g. to let Android players
install an older version compatible with Android).

**Note:** downloading archived mod versions is at your own risk, and mod authors often won't
provide support for them.

# Usage
To use this script:

1. Click the mod's "Files" tab on Nexus.
2. Click the "File Archive" button at the bottom (if it has any archived files).
3. Run the script as a bookmarklet or in the JavaScript console.
4. Click a download button to download that mod file.
